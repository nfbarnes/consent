### introductory notes on consent and content

many times we know the events or endings to stories before we begin reading -- we are even familiar with some or nearly all true / nonfiction or based-on-true-events stories (that's why we want to read more -- because we are already interested)

there is a strange value in the United States associated with a 'no spoilers' experience -- even that language of spoiling carries a heavy negative connotation

I propose that knowing more about a text initially, at the outset, can actually support our experience with the content -- and certainly, it can support our freedom to choose to engage with it

and, really, that is what consent is centered on: freedom

the freedom to choose for ourselves, with our understanding of where we are with our past and where we are in our present

consent is dynamic, and it is specific -- we may be comfortable with certain topics or aspects on some days or seasons and not at others -- and, I advocate for clear and specific accounting that explicitly addresses thematic components to support consensual engagement

#### what I learned from not watching the Steven Spielberg film, Schindler's List
this film was a big deal when it came out -- and it was created to retell a true story of the extremes: what humans are capable of as protectors and destroyers

I was already familiar with the historic accounts of Schindler's large-scale, secret liberatory trafficking -- and I also was already aware of many historic accounts of the atrocities of World War II

I decided I did not need to intentionally subject myself to the violence and trauma this film utilizes, so I have never seen it

and, I am so thankful to know the man lived and also to have avoided this emotional annihilation from internalizing this film

#### re / mediation

a former co-worker of mine, Rebekah Lane, is an intimacy choreographer

Lane consults, collaborates, and develops with actors how and where they will touch one another in a scene that contains intimacy -- could be a fight scene, a romantic or sexual episode, sometimes these take place together

so, when an audience attends a performance containing such a scene, it appears organic, natural, spontaneous -- when it is quite specifically mapped, rehearsed, and intentionally constructed so each performer knows precisely the placement of bodies and limbs -- how freeing, indeed

Lane's presence on stage expands the possibilities for embodied discourse as well as explicitly affirming the voicing of one's specific consent to physical contact -- she shifts the entire scope by opening the scenework / ers to consider placement and touch -- for example, you may place your hands on my back, above my waist and below my shoulders -- these are distinct, legible, reproducible actions that privilege collaboration and communication

Lane advocates for nightly or daily refresher conversations to adjust, modify, and confirm what will work for this specific performance

--we free each other as we free ourselves--

#### the language of lines and veils, defining where we might go and where we won't
