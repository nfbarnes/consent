### introductory notes on consent and content

many times we know the events or endings to stories before we begin reading -- we are familiar with some or nearly all true / nonfiction or based-on-true-events stories (that's why we want to read more -- because we are already interested)

there is a strange value associated with a 'no spoilers' experience -- even that language of spoiling carries a heavy negaitve connotation

I propose that knowing more about a text initially, at the outset, can actually support our experience with the content -- and certainly, it can support our freedom to choose to engage with it

and, really, that is what consent is centered on: freedom

the freedom to choose for ourselves, with our understanding of where we are with our past and where we are in our present
