### introductory notes on consent and content

many times we know the events or endings to stories before we begin reading -- we are even familiar with some or nearly all true / nonfiction or based-on-true-events stories (that's why we want to read more -- because we are already interested)

there is a strange value associated with a 'no spoilers' experience -- even that language of spoiling carries a heavy negative connotation

I propose that knowing more about a text initially, at the outset, can actually support our experience with the content -- and certainly, it can support our freedom to choose to engage with it

and, really, that is what consent is centered on: freedom

the freedom to choose for ourselves, with our understanding of where we are with our past and where we are in our present

consent is dynamic, and it is specific -- we may be comfortable with certain topics or aspects on some days or seasons and not at others -- and, I advocate for clear and specific accounting that explicitly addresses thematic components to support consensual engagement
