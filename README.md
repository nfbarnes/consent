# content + consent: a pedagogy resource with exercises

this is a pedagogical module I built that originated from a critical making project during doctoral coursework in texts and technology at the university of central florida with dr. anastasia salter (https://github.com/AMSUCF) during fall 2021

this is a public resource, and credits for included content are listed in https://github.com/nfbarnes/consent/blob/main/sources.md -- we expect any use of this content will be accompanied by full attribution

you are welcome to connect with me here or via nf.barnes@ucf.edu -- I'd love to expand this even more, and would be happy to link / fork, if that's helpful

original generation of the project: 


Within literature studies as well as creative writing workshops, there is a body of research on trauma, content, and student responses. Most of it uses the language of trigger warnings, though that is less productive to me, since it centers the trauma response instead of the people.  Two other fields can generate some interesting discourse: game studies and performance theater. In game studies, the conversation uses the language of “lines and veils” to build students’ vocabulary regarding their edges and boundaries when engaging with potentially harmful content. In performance theater, consent education is more established because the body is the instrument of engagement with bodies of other people. Student performers spend significant time understanding, exploring, communicating, and revising their own (and their classmates’) areas of consent. This exists in areas of performance that address stage combat / fighting / violence and also intimacy / sexual relationships. And, these are present in both fields / arenas.


With texts, trauma has been used as a surprise, and many instructors have resisted the conversations that take place before reading and analyzing possibly-harmful and/or disturbing content. I present the following engagement with the TimelineJS tool to teach familiarity with the tool as well as the discourse of consent when in the writing classroom.
