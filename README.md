# content + consent: a pedagogy resource with exercises

this is a pedagogical module I built that originated from a critical making project during doctoral coursework in texts and technology at the university of central florida with dr. anastasia salter (https://github.com/AMSUCF) during fall 2021

this is a public resource, and credits for included content are listed in https://github.com/nfbarnes/consent/blob/main/sources.md -- we expect any use of this content will be accompanied by full attribution

you are welcome to connect with me here or via nf.barnes@ucf.edu -- I'd love to expand this even more, and would be happy to link / fork, if that's helpful

how to survey and apply this content:


this work (even though coded line by line) is circular and spiral, meaning you can begin with any of the included files and move through the module slices in your preferred sequence --
even, returning to concepts and texts from a slice while addressing another


also, be present to your experinces with content warnings, lines and veils, subjects and themes that you have determined are outside the scope of your own engagement -- even the language of 'warnings' invokes the landscape of threat -- that is not what you will find here, a threatening landscape with embedded harms poised to jump-scare users into a state of triggered anxiety -- what you will find is language and materials that invite you and your collaborators (student or otherwise) to gently consider how and where your body and spirit experiences tenderness and to respond with compassion to yourself, to texts, to other people


the formatting and organization of this module and its supporting materials were created by me (a person) in a way that makes pedagogical sense to me for using with real humans in active, unscripted, collaborative contexts -- you may want to apply your own formatting for your purposes

original generation / concept of the project: 


Within literature studies as well as creative writing workshops, there is a body of research on trauma, content, and student responses. Most of it uses the language of trigger warnings, though that is less productive to me, since it centers the trauma response instead of the people.  Two other fields can generate some interesting discourse: game studies and performance theater. In game studies, the conversation uses the language of “lines and veils” to build students’ vocabulary regarding their edges and boundaries when engaging with potentially harmful content. In performance theater, consent education is more established because the body is the instrument of engagement with bodies of other people. Student performers spend significant time understanding, exploring, communicating, and revising their own (and their classmates’) areas of consent. This exists in areas of performance that address stage combat / fighting / violence and also intimacy / sexual relationships. And, these are present in both fields / arenas.


With texts, trauma has been used as a surprise, and many instructors have resisted the conversations that take place before reading and analyzing possibly-harmful and/or disturbing content. I present the following engagement with the TimelineJS tool to teach familiarity with the tool as well as the discourse of consent when in the writing classroom.
