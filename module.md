## >consent landscape<
our own body: an opening, exploratory sketch that introduces vulnerability, compassion, and embodied understanding of oneself

#### >> an in-progress mapping of the body, to begin to tour our interiors and exteriors -- an experience defining our 'local'


setting: consider that there are many settings acting on us at any given time

#### >> an in-progress mapping of our contexts, to begin to tour our interiors and exteriors -- an experience defining our 'global'



the body of a text: where / when is the woundedness within this text? what human encounters with weakness, resilience, pain, and empathy might accompany scenes and themes of violence? how / does this shift when harm is experienced within political landscapes? the land/scape itself?


the body's experience of the past and of a text --> it cannot tell the difference between then and now or an irl physical event or one that you imagine from a text

## >what does consent have to do with content<
imagine if you were trusted and empowered to make a decision about what texts you will draw inside you? 
consider the role of surprise when playing a game, reading a book, moving through an exhibit? 
have there been times when you were harmed by content without your consent?
## trust and confidence among writers / creators and readers / users: safety and expectations
## engaging with texts 
## making texts
## responding to classroom colleagues
