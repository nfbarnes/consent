## CONTEXTS >consent landscape<
our own body: an opening, exploratory sketch that introduces vulnerability, compassion, and embodied understanding of oneself

#### >> an in-progress mapping of the body, to begin to tour our interiors and exteriors -- an experience defining our 'local'


setting: consider that there are many settings acting on us at any given time

#### >> an in-progress mapping of our contexts, to begin to tour our interiors and exteriors -- an experience defining our 'global'


the body of a text: where / when is the woundedness within this text? what human encounters with weakness, resilience, pain, and empathy might accompany scenes and themes of violence? how / does this shift when harm is experienced within political landscapes? the land/scape itself?

the body's experience of the past and of a text --> it cannot tell the difference between then and now or an irl physical event or one that you imagine from a text

[TimelineJS] (https://github.com/nfbarnes/consent/blob/main/timelinejs.md) >> begin to input these moments -- at this early stage, you are not expected to have any overall organization -- only to plot points that correspond in your chronology




## LANGUAGE >what does consent have to do with content<
iimagine if you were trusted and empowered to make a decision about what texts you will draw inside you? consider the role of surprise when playing a game, reading a book, moving through an exhibit? have there been times when you were harmed by content without your consent? have there been times when content was introduced to you via consent (either in personal circumstances or public situations)?

TimelineJS >> continue to add these -- you may decide to include simultaneous timeline moments such as publication / book history and any other relevant public and cultural moments with relevance and resonance to you




## EXPERIENCES >trust and confidence among writers / creators and readers / users: safety and expectations<

moving within the personal and public, consider what social contracts that content creators are / not aware of, as well as are / not responsible for -- what is the role and function of introductory labels such as book flap text, exhibition panels, etc. -- are there violations? inherent risks? how can these expectations be re / shaped?

when you occupy the space of content creator, how have you acted and made decisions? what do you want to do in current and future works you create?

TimelineJS >> consider expanding your project here beyond only your experiences and include moments (personal and / or public) that address risk, safety, expectation, and harms
